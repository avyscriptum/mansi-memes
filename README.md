**Mansi Memes** is a project about creating memes in the Mansi language — one of the endangered Indigenous languages of Siberia.

## Why?

Memes are a simple and lively way to share thoughts and emotions. With funny pictures, I want to support interest in a language and culture that are at risk of disappearing.

## How does it work?

I study scans of old dictionaries and textbooks, write down words into my own vocabulary list, and then use templates I like to create memes — with translations into English, Russian, and Esperanto!

### Esperanto?...

> I translate memes into English, Russian, and Esperanto so that both Russian speakers and people interested in linguistics and endangered languages can understand them. Esperanto is my way to make the project accessible to the world.

### Dictionaries and textbooks I use:

- **Short Mansi–Russian Dictionary** — *Chernetsov, Chernetsova*, 1936 (4,000 words)
- **Mansi–Russian Dictionary** — *Balandin, Varkhushev*, 1958
